Configuration A was the identity baseline and had no selected PPO model path. The signal gate failed because mean OOS IC was below its required threshold. The final production gate also failed, including the positive-return significance check. Positive holdout return and positive 2x-cost return remain evidence, but they do not override failed mandatory gates.

The migration fixture exists to prevent this evidence from being mislabeled as a selected policy ensemble or a production release.
